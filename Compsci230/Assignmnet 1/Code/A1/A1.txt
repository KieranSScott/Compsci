This assignment took me approximitally 12 hours.
I found the bouncing class, moving rectangle and moving sqaure easy (along with the basic changes to A1.java)
I found the drawHandles differcult because I was not working for close to 5 hours but then some how started working the next day. Also I was over complecating the polymophised methods in movingSqaure which wasted a lot of time.
The topics that the assignment helped me most understand was GUI.
I have no other comments.
